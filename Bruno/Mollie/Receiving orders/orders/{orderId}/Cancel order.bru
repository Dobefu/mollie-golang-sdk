  **⚠️ We no longer recommend using the Orders API. Please refer to the [Payments API](payments-api) instead.**
  
  An open order may be canceled if it does not have any open payments yet, and while its status is either `created`, `authorized`, or `shipping`.
  
  If the order was already authorized, the authorization will be released.
  
  For an order with status `shipping`, only the order lines that were still pending will be canceled if possible. If a payment method was used that does not support authorizations, cancelation is no longer possible. You will have to issue a refund instead.
